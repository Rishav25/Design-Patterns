Used when we need to create objects based on some conditions.
If there is a large codebase, and objects need to be created conditionally, then we need to write the conditional
logic in all places where the object will be created.
Instead we use the factory pattern, where we write the logic only in the factory and use the factory to create 
various shapes

Shape Interface -> used by different concrete classes
Shape Factory -> has a function called createShape which creates the concrete shapes

as a thumb rule in SOLID -> D -> Dependency Inversion. Always create the object in the highest level, as in,
in the parent level. and create the child object using different params.
