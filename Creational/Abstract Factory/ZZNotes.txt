This is a 2 layer factory model.

We have a superFactory which will create a vehicle object using a factory object.
Each of these factories are then just like the normal factory.

Here, we create the objects using the superFactory by passing appropriate params, 
the params should identify which factory to use, and which object to create

helps us maintain code in better way in cases when a single factory might be handling huge number of object creations.
We can then divide the factory into 2 parts and use a super factory to create the object using the individual 
factories
