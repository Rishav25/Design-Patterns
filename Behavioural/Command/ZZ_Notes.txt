We use this design pattern when we have to pass a command to an object. These are helpful in undo redo operations too.

Here we have 3 things:
1. Invoker
2. Commands
3. Receiver

The client uses the Invoker, the Invoker Commands the Receiver.

We have an Invoker which HAS A Command, Command HAS A Receiver. i.e. the Command Constructor will have the AC Object in it.
The Concrete Command has an execute function which is called by the Invoker.

Client HAS A Invoker and HAS A Receiver.

For the Undo-Redo we can use Stack inside the Invoker.
