This design pattern is used in combination with Factory Design pattern.
We use this to handle nulls gracefully.
without this pattern, at each step we would have to do this if(obj != null), then perform actions on obj

Here, we create a NullObject class along with the other elements and in the default behaviour of the factory, we create this NullObject.
