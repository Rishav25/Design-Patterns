This is a very important design pattern.
This is used as a control before or after the client request is performed.
Used in Access Restriction, Checking Cache, Pre Processing

Here, we have an abstract class/ interface which has functions.
These functions are implemented by the concrete class
the proxy class implements the pre processing and then it sends the control to the concrete class, if it has to send it there

in the client, here Main.java, we create a ProxyClass Object and we call the functions from that proxy Object

We can use Proxy and Decorator pattern in combination to create multiple proxy layers for a request.

Simple -> call proxy from client. 
proxy sends the request to the concrete class after performing it's own operations.
